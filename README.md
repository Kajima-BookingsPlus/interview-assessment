# Dependencies

The sample application uses Ruby 3.2.2 and Node 16.0.0

# Task: Confirm a booking

Within our sample booking application we have provisional bookings and we need to confirm these.

Upon confirming a booking, users associated with the booking may receive a confirmation message - this can be an email or an SMS.

The content of the message is not important, its just that we trigger the appropriate message delivery method.

## Requirements

Create a Rails API endpoint to transition a provisional booking to the confirmed state.

`PATCH /api/v1/bookings/:id/confirm`

### Params

| name                  | value               | required |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| send_confirmation_msg | Boolean             | N        |
| confirmation_type     | String (email, sms) | N        |

1. Update the booking state from `provisional` to `confirmed` (see confirmation rules)

2. Set the timestamp for `confirmed_at` and who the user confirming the booking is

3. Send a confirmation notification to:

   - The user associated with the booking
   - The host associated with the booking (if the host is present)

- If `send_confirmation_msg` param is present then a confirmation message should be sent to both the booking user and the booking host
- If `confirmation_type` param is set to `:sms` then send a SMS (use `SMSSender.new(number, msg).deliver` - its in the lib directory)
- If `confirmation_type` param is set to `:email` then send a email
- If `confirmation_type` is not set then send an email

### Confirmation Rules

A booking will transition through many states in its lifetime.

| State       | Description                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Provisional | Booking has just been made                                    |
| Confirmed   | Admin has confirmed bookings or user has paid for the booking |
| Cancelled   | Admin or user has cancelled the booking                       |
| Expired     | Booking was not confirmed and is in the past                  |

#### Rules

- Unapproved users cannot confirm bookings
- Users can only confirm their own bookings
- Bookings in the past cannot be confirmed
- Confirmed bookings cannot be re-confirmed
- Cancelled bookings cannot be confirmed
- Expired bookings cannot be confirmed
